## Welcome to the Djinn Engine!
Currently, this engine is in its very very early form.  In fact, at the moment, it can only support gravitational forces, spring forces, 
a generic "uplift" force, and some others with demos only built for gravity (solarsystem and lunarorbit).  You can run the demos by cloning the repository, compiling the code, and running the demos found in src/demos/.

This repository was made as a means of quickly sharing my codebase to people so they can help me troubleshoot problems/offer help in the design of the engine.

Djinn is heavily (but not entirely) based on the paradigms introduced in "Game Physics Engine Development" by Ian Millington.  His GitHub -- and the Cyclone engine upon which Djinn is based -- can be found [here](https://github.com/idmillington).

Current To-do list:
- Implement electromagnetism
- Finish collision resolution
- Make a graphical demo for the spring-mass system depicted in src/demos/springmass.cpp
- Come up with more ideas for demos
