## Welcome to the Djinn Engine!
Currently, this engine is in its very very early form.  In fact, at the moment, it can only support gravitational forces, spring forces, 
and a generic "uplift" force, with demos only built for gravity.

This repository was made as a means of quickly sharing my codebase to people so they can help me troubleshoot problems/offer help in the design of the engine.

Djinn is heavily (but not entirely) based on the paradigms introduced in "Game Physics Engine Development" by Ian Millington (his GitHub) can be found [here](https://github.com/idmillington)

Current To-do list:
- Implement electromagnetism
- Finish collision resolution
- Make a graphical demo for the spring-mass system depicted in src/demos/springmass.cpp
- Come up with more ideas for demos
