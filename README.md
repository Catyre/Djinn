** Welcome to the Djinn Engine!
Currently, this engine is in its very very early form.  In fact, at the moment, it can only support orbit of gravitational bodies, and even
then it's rough going...

This repository was made as a means of quickly sharing my codebase to people so they can help me troubleshoot problems/offer help in the design
of the engine.
